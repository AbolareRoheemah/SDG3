            <p class="card-text">Healthcare systems across the region are rapidly evolving, with overall healthcare spending projected to surge to US$2.3 trillion by 2026. Aging populations and the rapidly growing burden from noncommunicable diseases — fueled in part by an increasingly urbanized lifestyle — are driving demand. Especially in Southeast Asia, private healthcare providers are capitalizing on this demand by addressing the systemic issues in public health.

              The healthcare systems in many developing markets are constrained. For example, public hospitals are often overcrowded and plagued by a shortage of doctors, medical supplies and diagnostic equipment, which affects the quality of care. These strains on APAC’s health infrastructure present significant opportunities to reduce reliance on hospital-centric care. Models such as ambulatory surgery centers, home care and telehealth will therefore flourish.</p>

            <p class="card-text"></p>Countries around the world are facing common challenges and opportunities impacting the health of their citizens and their healthcare systems: aging populations, increase in chronic disease, healthcare cost growth outpacing economic growth, consumer access to health information, and unprecedented technological innovation (e.g., medical and pharmaceutical technology, information technology).

            Against this backdrop, each region and country is confronting a unique combination of dynamics that challenge their healthcare systems to deliver better outcomes at a reduced cost burden.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">We Act</h5>
            <p class="card-text">For such a massive industry, most healthcare spending remains a local game. Constituents throughout the healthcare value chain face highly dynamic environments that are impacted by a number of key trends, including an aging and less healthy population; political and regulatory uncertainty; migration to value-based and accountable care models; integration across the care continuum; payer and provider consolidation; new and increased access to data, innovation and technology; increasing levels of consumer engagement and expectations; and increasing recognition of the role of social determinants of health. To make matters more complex, participants are migrating into each other’s spaces, and nonparticipants are entering the healthcare fray. For example, managed care organizations are buying providers; providers are offering health plans; and Apple, Google and other iconic brands are finding ways into the consumer engagement arena.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">We support</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In Europe, aging populations are placing significant burdens on healthcare delivery systems and payers to “do more, better, with less.” Providers are working to drive clinical excellence and consistency across their activities, and to create improved linkages across different care pathway settings. Ancillary service providers, such as diagnostic imaging, dialysis and pathology lab companies, are using operational best practices across their increasingly international networks to improve quality for lower cost. Clinicians are adapting to growing demands on their time by incorporating increasing levels of digitization in their workflows. And patients are looking to technology to inform their healthcare decision-making and, in some markets, paying for accelerated access to healthcare in response to lengthening public sector waiting times.</p>
